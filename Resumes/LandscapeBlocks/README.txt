This resume was one that I did for my ultra talented friend. I figure that it was there so why not give it a go. The focus was showing an increasing ammount of skill and responsibility. The landscape was dictated by the fact that the job history was greater than 3 or 4 and the resume was atypical so it was acceptable.
